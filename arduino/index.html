	<h3>Why use an Arduino?</h3>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is easy to learn</h3>
	  <p>The Arduino programming language was built on Processing, a language that was meant to be picked up by non-technical people like artists. There's no need to spend days getting your first success: just upload the first demo, and you're there.</p>

	  <p>Language constructs are just enough (no OOP), wraps low-level things nicely, one-download IDE+beginning sketches, works with USB almost out of the box, don't need a dedicated programmer, </p>

	  <h4>A programming language?</h4>
	  <h4>Processing?</h4>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is (relatively) cheap</h3>
	  <p>True, <a href="http://hackaday.com/2010/06/22/ti-makes-a-big-bid-for-the-hobby-market/">there are cheaper boards out there</a>, but the other factors listed here more than make up for whatever wallet pains the $30 for an Arduino will put you at</p>

	  <p>Otherwise, you might be stuck programming on an actual computer, might blow your motherboard with reverse polarity. Dev boards go for a little above the price point. Besides, you don't need to eat for a few days, right?</p>

	  <h4>Where can I get an Arduino?</h4>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is kind of a big deal (community)</h3>
	  <p>People everywhere use Arduino: it really jumped out of the more traditional EE community and made it's home with artists and non-techs.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is open source</h3>
	  <p>This means you yourself can change anything about the platform.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is good enough</h3>
	  <p>You'll eventually need more horsepower: for now, it'll probably be good enough</p>
	</div>


	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino types</h3>
	  <p>Main boards</p>

	  <p>Beefy boards</p>

	  <p>Tiny boards</p>

	<div>
	  <h3>History</h3>
	  <p>Arduino has had a long and illustrious history, beginning in 2005.</p>

	  <p>You know what, I'm not going to write what others have already talked about: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino#History">Here's the Wikipedia article</a>. <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Boards">Board ancestry</a></p>

	<h2>How do you use an Arduino?</h2>
	<p>Install the software, plug it in, upload the blink demo, rejoice</p>
	<div>
	  <h3>Get an Arduino</h3>
	  <p>If you're following this as part of a workshop, then you should have boards provided to you. NO! STEALING BAD! BAD HUMAN!</p>

	  <p>These are a few good sources for buying boards.</p>
	  
	  <ul>
	    <li>Sparkfun</li>
	    <li>Adafruit</li>
	    <li>???</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>An uptodate list is at maintained by the folks over at Arduino.cc: <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy">list by region</a> (aw yeah savin' on shipping!)</p>
	</div>
	<div>
	  <h3>Install the software</h3>
	  <p>
	    Currently version 0022
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Okay, let's make sure it runs
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Okay, now we need drivers. Which ones we need depend on the Arduino you have, and which OS you're using

	    <div>Wait! What's a driver?</div>

	    <div>Wait! How do you tell which Arduino you have?</div>

	    <ul>
	      <li>Uno</li>
	      <li>Duemilanove</li>
	      <li>Diecimila</li>
	      <li>Lilypad</li>
	      <li>BT</li>
	      <li>Otherwise:</li>
