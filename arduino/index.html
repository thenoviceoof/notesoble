	<h3>Why use an Arduino?</h3>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is easy to learn</h3>
	  <p>The Arduino programming language was built on <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, a language that was meant to be picked up by non-technical people like artists. Your first win is in minutes, not days or years: just upload the first demo, and you're there.</p>

	  <p>Language constructs are just enough (nothing fancy), wraps low-level things nicely, one-download IDE+beginning sketches, works with USB almost out of the box, and you don't need a dedicated programmer. </p>

	  <h3>Wait, slow down!</h3>
	  <div>
	    <h4>What's programming language?</h4>
	    <p>It's pretty much the way </p>

	    <h4>Hmm, what's Processing?</h4>
	    <p></p>
	  </div>

	  <h3>Huh, how do I learn more?</h3>
	  <p></p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is (relatively) cheap</h3>
	  <p>True, <a href="http://hackaday.com/2010/06/22/ti-makes-a-big-bid-for-the-hobby-market/">there are cheaper boards out there</a>, but the other factors listed here more than make up for whatever wallet pains the $30 for an Arduino will put you at</p>

	  <p>Otherwise, you might be stuck programming on an actual computer, might blow your motherboard with reverse polarity. Dev boards go for a little above the price point. Besides, you don't need to eat for a few days, right?</p>

	  <h4>Where can I get an Arduino?</h4>
	  <p>Hold your horses! Let's wait for the actual tutorial-portion of the tutorial to get to that. Or you can skip ahead.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is kind of a big deal (community)</h3>
	  <p>People everywhere use Arduino: it really jumped out of the more traditional EE community and made it's home with artists and non-techs, enabling a "make" culture that encourages tinkering and, well, making.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is extensible</h3>
	  <p>There are these things called shields that expand the capabilities of Arduino boards.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is open source</h3>
	  <p>This means you are free to do anything you please with the arduino platform</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is good enough</h3>
	  <p>You can't play Crysis on it, but it can enable all sorts of smart applications. Just don't expect it to stop you from crashing a car</p>
	</div>


	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino types</h3>
	  <p>Main boards</p>
	  <p>These boards are kind of the workhorse of the Arduino family: they contain just enough processing power to be interesting, but also balance cost.</p>

	  <p>Beefy boards</p>
	  <p>Usually postfixed with "mega", these have more processing power, memory, and input/output pins for larger projects.</p>

	  <p>Tiny boards</p>
	  <p>When space is at a premium.</p>

	  <p>Special boards</p>
	  <p>Usually fill some niche, like wireless communication.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>History</h3>
	  <p>Arduino has had a long and illustrious history, beginning in 2005.</p>

	  <p>You know what, I'm not going to write what others have already talked about: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino#History">Here's the Wikipedia article</a>. <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Boards">Board ancestry</a></p>
	</div>
	
      </div>
      <div>
	<h2>How do you use an Arduino?</h2>
	<p>Install the software, plug it in, upload the blink demo, rejoice.</p>
	<button>Wait! Can you go through that slower?</button>

	<div>
	  <input type="checkbox" /><h3>Get an Arduino</h3>
	  <p>If you're following this as part of a workshop, then you should have boards provided to you. NO! STEALING BAD! BAD HUMAN!</p>
	  <h3>Not in a workshop?</h3>
	  <p>
	    There are a metric fuckton of places to get an Arduino.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <lh>In the states?</lh>
	    <li><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a>: caters to hobbyists. They carry so many Arduino things, including the latest <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9950">Uno</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.makershed.com/Arduinos_Accessories_s/43.htm">Make</a>: in addition to putting out <a href="http://www.makershed.com/Arduinos_Accessories_s/43.htm">Make magazine</a>, they also enable makers, and carry Arduino stuff. <a href="http://www.makershed.com/product_p/mksp4.htm">Arduino Uno</a></li>
	    <li><a href="">Adafruit</a>: basically an electronics tutorial company that happens to sell the stuff you need to do the tutorials. <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/50">Arduino Uno</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  <ul>
	    <lh>Not in the states?</lh>
	    <li>Haven't had much experience ordering from outside of the states, but <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy">arduino.cc maintains a big list of suppliers.</a></li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>An up-to-date list is at maintained by the folks over at Arduino.cc: <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy">list by region</a> (aw yeah savin' on shipping!)</p>
	</div>
	<div>
	  <h3>Install the software</h3>
	  <input type="checkbox" />
	  <p>Download the Arduino software</p>
	  <p>
	    You want the latest version of the software: version 22 (or more accurately, 0022) is currently the latest. arduino.cc has a nice download page for all teh major platforms (Windows, OS X (Mac), Linux), so head on over and download it. You'll need to have java installed for arduino to work: http://java.com/en/download/testjava.jsp. If the test failed, you need to install java from http://java.com
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Okay, let's make sure it runs: unzip the file you just downloaded and double click on the arduino program. You should get a box that looks similar to this ### screenshot.
	  </p>
	  <input type="checkbox" />
	  <p>Download the USB drivers</p>
	  <p>
	    Okay, now we need drivers. Which ones we need depend on the Arduino you have, and which OS you're using

	    <div>Wait! What's a driver?</div>
	    <p>A driver is a piece of software that allows the arduino software (the blue, boxy program we just ran) to talk to the arduino hardware (the physical board).</p>

	    <div>Wait! How do you tell which Arduino you have?</div>
	    <p>If you've been given the Arduino in a workshop, your presenter should be able to tell you what model you have. Otherwise, go to the page and squint at the various forms until you find which one is yours. If you don't see yours, it might be homebrew or a custom derivative.</p>

	    <ul>
	      <lh>Still don't know which one you have?</lh>
	      <li>Uno <p>It looks like </p></li>
	      <li>Duemilanove</li>
	      <li>Diecimila</li>
	      <li>Lilypad</li>
	      <li>BT</li>
	      <li>Otherwise:</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <input type="checkbox" />
	  <h3>Connect to the Arduino</h3>
	  <p>Plug it in</p>
	  <p>You should have a USB cable: if you don't have a A-B USB cable, you should be able to grab one for around 5USD. There's really only one way to fit the USB cable between your computer and your arduino.</p>
	  What is an A-B USB cable?
	  Image
	  <p>Wait, which end goes where?</p>
	  <p>Put the rectangular end of the USB cable into your computer: put the square end of the USB cable into the Arduino. </p>

	  <p>Open the blink demo</p>
	  <p>If you don't have your arduino software still open, open it back up. Now, open the menu File>Examples>Basic>Blink: it will open a new window and you should see some code in the new arduino window. Choose your board under the menu Tools>Board. Click the verify ("play") button: you should get a "Done Compiling" message at the bottom of the window.</p>
	  <p>Step-by-step</p>
	  What the Arduino software looks like:
	  Where to get the Blink demo:
	  Where play/verify and where the messages pop up:


	  <p>Upload the sketch</p>
	  <p>Now that the code has been verified, we can actually upload it to the board: making sure that the arduino is connected, click the upload button (sideways arrow). After a few seconds, a "Successful Upload" message should display at the bottom of the window, and the LED built into the arduino should start to blink!</p>

	  <p>Troubleshooting</p>
	  <p>If the upload fails, trying hitting the reset button when you upload: some older boards can't auto-reset</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <input type="checkbox" />
	  <h3>How to use different electrical components</h3>
	  <p>Note: it is a good idea to power down (disconnect) the board when you connect or disconnect various electrical components to it (aside from the USB cable, obviously).</p>

	  <p>External LED</p>
	  <p>Since there is only one LED on the board, if we want more LED action we need to hook up external LEDs. </p>
	  ### Do we HAVE to use a resistor? Does the pull up offer enough resistance?

	  What's a pin?
	  A pin is a the way the microcontroller talks with the outside world, named so because of the pins that extend from the packaging of the component.

	  What sorts of pins are there?
	  First, we distinguish what pins do: are they talking, or listening? A single pin can't do both at the same time, similar to how listening with your mouth is pretty difficult. This is why many methods of electronic communication require at least 2 pins: there are ways to talk with only one pin, but they require their own constraints.

	  How to think about voltage?
	  By analogy: if electricity is analogous to water, a battery pumps water up a hill. Then, if current (water) flows over a resistor (waterfall) it drops some voltage.
	  More rigorously: ### gonna punt on this

	  Code: digitalOut
	  ###

	  If you can, use a breadboard.
	  This makes it easy to connect things in serial (linking together parts in serial).

	  How to breadboard?
	  If you're with a workshop, they should cover this.
	  Otherwise, you should have a breadboard (### pic), a collection of wires (### pic), an arduino, and whatever components you need (resistors, capacitors, etc). Now, each row of the breadboard is electrically connected, as well as the "rails" which run down the side of the breadboards (your breadboard should look similar, but may be missing the rails). ###


	  <p>One light, two light, red light, green light</p>
	  Okay, so how do you use multiple LEDs? In this case, we hook up two LEDs to two different pins, and then call digitalout on each of them.

	  diagram

	  Hooking them to the same pin means they work exactly the same

	  diagram

	  example code (turn one on, turn the other off)
	  ###

	  The code goes first, then second, but it's quick enough that we can't tell

	  <p>Speaker</p>
	  One way to do it is with digitalOut, and switch that really fast

	  How does digital audio work?
	  Continuous vs. discrete

	<h2>Okay, that was fun. What now?</h2>

	<h3>Next steps</h3>
	Where better to go next than the Arduino.cc site itself?

	http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage

	Adafruit also has a bunch of beginner tutorials, with many wider electrical projects ranging outside of Arduino.

	<h3>Wait! How do you do this specific thing??</h3>

	<p>How do you control lots of LEDs?</p>
	Get yourself an LED shield. A start can be had from <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/rgb-led-shield-v14-kit-p-430.html">Seeedstudio</a>. 16 LEDs not enough for you? What about 64 LEDs on a shield from <a href="http://timewitharduino.blogspot.com/2011/08/new-in-store-bi-color-led-mini-display.html">TimeWithArduino.com</a>? Need higher power? Want to break out of the boards?

	<p>How do you control motors?</p>
	Almost any sort of motor will demand more "electricity" than an Arduino can provide. You'll want a certain shield for a certain type of motor:
	<ul>
	  <li>DC motor. <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/">LadyAda's mshield</a> looks promising</li>
	  <li>Stepper motor</li>
	  <li>Servo</li>
	</ul>

	<p>How do I talk with it with my computer?</p>
	<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/serial">Use serial.</a> You can use the built-in serial monitor to talk to your board.

	<p>How do I get arduinos to talk to each other?</p>
	You can use serial (again), or talk wireless with something like xbee

	<p>How do you get cameras working with it?</p>
	Cameras are really high bandwidth, as well as memory intensive, so using cameras with Arduinos is not such a good idea. Really. However, there are <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/InterfacingWithHardware#Visual">plenty of hacks involving controlling cameras with Arduinos</a>.

	<p>How can I get internet?</p>
	Surprise! <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEthernet">There's a specialty Arduino board with an Ethernet jack built into it</a>, as well as an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield">official ethernet shield</a>. You want wifi? <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9954">Sparkfun carries a WiFly shield</a>. If you're actually looking for the more mundane problem of networking several Arduinos together, then you should see the above section on getting Arduinos to talk to each other.

	<p>How can I voice activate it?</p>
	Getting your Arduino to respond to verbal commands would be extremely difficult, but you can connect a microphone to the analog I/O pins easily enough... but wait! It'll almost definitely be too quiet, so you need to amplify the signal. Sparkfun has packaged it up into a board http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9964

	<p>How do I make a robot with it?</p>
	Attach some motors through a motor shield
	Get some switches to act as bump sensors.
	Read the switches with digitalread
	Move motors appropriately.
	Hell, why am I even trying to explain this here? You should go google it, there's a ton of material on this.

	But, but, where's my humanoid robot?!
	As of now, you're gonna have to go work in a robotics lab

	<p>How do I get it to serve me coffee in the morning?</p>
	The science of coffee automation rapidly advances at a breakneck pace: if you wish to enter this cut-throat field, this wiki is chockfull of information that may prove useful to your efforts. Godspeed.

	Thanks for reading!
