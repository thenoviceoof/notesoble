	<h3>Why use an Arduino?</h3>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is easy to learn</h3>
	  <p>The Arduino programming language was built on <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, a language that was meant to be picked up by non-technical people like artists. Your first win is in minutes, not days or years: just upload the first demo, and you're there.</p>

	  <p>Language constructs are just enough (nothing fancy), wraps low-level things nicely, one-download IDE+beginning sketches, works with USB almost out of the box, and you don't need a dedicated programmer. </p>

	  <h3>Wait, slow down!</h3>
	  <div>
	    <h4>What's programming language?</h4>
	    <p>It's pretty much the way </p>

	    <h4>Hmm, what's Processing?</h4>
	    <p></p>
	  </div>

	  <h3>Huh, how do I learn more?</h3>
	  <p></p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is (relatively) cheap</h3>
	  <p>True, <a href="http://hackaday.com/2010/06/22/ti-makes-a-big-bid-for-the-hobby-market/">there are cheaper boards out there</a>, but the other factors listed here more than make up for whatever wallet pains the $30 for an Arduino will put you at</p>

	  <p>Otherwise, you might be stuck programming on an actual computer, might blow your motherboard with reverse polarity. Dev boards go for a little above the price point. Besides, you don't need to eat for a few days, right?</p>

	  <h4>Where can I get an Arduino?</h4>
	  <p>Hold your horses! Let's wait for the actual tutorial-portion of the tutorial to get to that. Or you can skip ahead.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is kind of a big deal (community)</h3>
	  <p>People everywhere use Arduino: it really jumped out of the more traditional EE community and made it's home with artists and non-techs, enabling a "make" culture that encourages tinkering and, well, making.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is extensible</h3>
	  <p>There are these things called shields that expand the capabilities of Arduino boards.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is open source</h3>
	  <p>This means you are free to do anything you please with the arduino platform</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino is good enough</h3>
	  <p>You can't play Crysis on it, but it can enable all sorts of smart applications. Just don't expect it to stop you from crashing a car</p>
	</div>


	<div>
	  <h3>Arduino types</h3>
	  <p>Main boards</p>
	  <p>These boards are kind of the workhorse of the Arduino family: they contain just enough processing power to be interesting, but also balance cost.</p>

	  <p>Beefy boards</p>
	  <p>Usually postfixed with "mega", these have more processing power, memory, and input/output pins for larger projects.</p>

	  <p>Tiny boards</p>
	  <p>When space is at a premium.</p>

	  <p>Special boards</p>
	  <p>Usually fill some niche, like wireless communication.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <h3>History</h3>
	  <p>Arduino has had a long and illustrious history, beginning in 2005.</p>

	  <p>You know what, I'm not going to write what others have already talked about: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino#History">Here's the Wikipedia article</a>. <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Boards">Board ancestry</a></p>
	</div>
	
      </div>
      <div>
	<h2>How do you use an Arduino?</h2>
	<p>Install the software, plug it in, upload the blink demo, rejoice.</p>
	<button>Wait! Can you go through that slower?</button>

	<div>
	  <input type="checkbox" /><h3>Get an Arduino</h3>
	  <p>If you're following this as part of a workshop, then you should have boards provided to you. NO! STEALING BAD! BAD HUMAN!</p>
	  <h3>Not in a workshop?</h3>
	  <p>
	    There are a metric fuckton of places to get an Arduino.
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <lh>In the states?</lh>
	    <li><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a>: caters to hobbyists. They carry so many Arduino things, including the latest <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9950">Uno</a></li>
	    <li><a href="http://www.makershed.com/Arduinos_Accessories_s/43.htm">Make</a>: in addition to putting out <a href="http://www.makershed.com/Arduinos_Accessories_s/43.htm">Make magazine</a>, they also enable makers, and carry Arduino stuff. <a href="http://www.makershed.com/product_p/mksp4.htm">Arduino Uno</a></li>
	    <li><a href="">Adafruit</a>: basically an electronics tutorial company that happens to sell the stuff you need to do the tutorials. <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/50">Arduino Uno</a></li>
	  </ul>
	  <ul>
	    <lh>Not in the states?</lh>
	    <li>Haven't had much experience ordering from outside of the states, but <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy">arduino.cc maintains a big list of suppliers.</a></li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>An uptodate list is at maintained by the folks over at Arduino.cc: <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy">list by region</a> (aw yeah savin' on shipping!)</p>

	  </p>
	  <input type="checkbox" />
	  <p>Download the USB drivers</p>
	  <p>
	    Okay, now we need drivers. Which ones we need depend on the Arduino you have, and which OS you're using

	    <div>Wait! What's a driver?</div>

	    <div>Wait! How do you tell which Arduino you have?</div>
	    <p>If you've been given the Arduino in a workshop, your presenter should be able to tell you what model you have. Otherwise, go to the page and squint at the various forms until you got it</p>

	    <ul>
	      <li>Uno</li>
	      <li>Duemilanove</li>
	      <li>Diecimila</li>

	      <li>BT</li>
	      <li>Otherwise:</li>
	    </ul>
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div>
	  <input type="checkbox" /><h3>Connect to the Arduino</h3>
	  <p>Plug it in</p>
	  Put the rectangular end of the USB cable into your computer
	  Put the square end of the USB cable into the Arduino

	  Troubleshooting

	  <p>Open the blink demo</p>

	  Theremin?
	</div>
      </div>
      <div>
	<h2>Okay, that was fun. What now?</h2>

	<h3>Next steps</h3>
	Where better to go next than the Arduino.cc site itself?

	http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage

	Adafruit also has a bunch of beginner tutorials, with many wider electrical projects ranging outside of Arduino.

	<h3>Wait! How do you do this specific thing??</h3>

	<p>How do you control lots of LEDs?</p>
	Get yourself an LED shield. A start can be had from <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/rgb-led-shield-v14-kit-p-430.html">Seeedstudio</a>. 16 LEDs not enough for you? What about 64 LEDs on a shield from <a href="http://timewitharduino.blogspot.com/2011/08/new-in-store-bi-color-led-mini-display.html">TimeWithArduino.com</a>? Need higher power? Want to break out of the boards?

	<p>How do you control motors?</p>
	Almost any sort of motor will demand more "electricity" than an Arduino can provide. You'll want a certain shield for a certain type of motor:
	<ul>
	  <li>DC motor. <a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/mshield/">LadyAda's mshield</a> looks promising</li>
	  <li>Stepper motor</li>
	  <li>Servo</li>
	</ul>

	<p>How do I talk with it with my computer?</p>
	<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/serial">Use serial.</a> You can use the built-in serial monitor to talk to your board.

	<p>How do I get arduinos to talk to each other?</p>
	You can use serial (again), or talk wireless with something like xbee

	<p>How do you get cameras working with it?</p>
	Cameras are really high bandwidth, as well as memory intensive, so using cameras with Arduinos is not such a good idea. Really. However, there are <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/InterfacingWithHardware#Visual">plenty of hacks involving controlling cameras with Arduinos</a>.

	<p>How can I get internet?</p>
	Surprise! <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardEthernet">There's a specialty Arduino board with an Ethernet jack built into it</a>, as well as an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield">official ethernet shield</a>. You want wifi? <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9954">Sparkfun carries a WiFly shield</a>. If you're actually looking for the more mundane problem of networking several Arduinos together, then you should see the above section on getting Arduinos to talk to each other.

	<p>How can I voice activate it?</p>
	Getting your Arduino to respond to verbal commands would be extremely difficult, but you can connect a microphone to the analog I/O pins easily enough... but wait! It'll almost definitely be too quiet, so you need to amplify the signal. Sparkfun has packaged it up into a board http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9964

	<p>How do I make a robot with it?</p>
	Attach some motors through a motor shield
	Get some switches to act as bump sensors.
	Read the switches with digitalread
	Move motors appropriately.
	Hell, why am I even trying to explain this here? You should go google it, there's a ton of material on this.

	But, but, where's my humanoid robot?!
	As of now, you're gonna have to go work in a robotics lab

	<p>How do I get it to serve me coffee in the morning?</p>
	The science of coffee automation rapidly advances at a breakneck pace: if you wish to enter this cut-throat field, this wiki is chockfull of information that may prove useful to your efforts. Godspeed.

	Thanks for reading!
