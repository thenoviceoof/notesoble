--------------------------------------------------
WHAT???
--------------------------------------------------

writing documents in a quick way (taking notes)
writing a document in a details-on-demand way
combine both of them?!

--------------------------------------------------
IDEAS
--------------------------------------------------

2 ways to do things when folding out: hide previous, or keep
  default - keep

resource tracking - auto, by convention ~ latex tracking
	 reference integration?

auto indexing - words

have to do node.js - talking to the backend

integrate mathjax

some sort of syntax highlighter

integrate some sort of persistant protovis thing?

table editor?

emacs/vim (hard) keybindings

side-by-side docs/notes
	     tree'd out structures?

handle notes and other asides

--------------------------------------------------
TODO
--------------------------------------------------

Right now, working on generating the detailed documents
get a reference compiler? - in javascript? python?
    javascript: just import the json, have to have it anyways
    have something to demo
hmm, should I try to figure out wave in a box?
     no, wave isn't targeted towards the project goals
     I don't think it would be easily hackable
     well, we're about to find out
